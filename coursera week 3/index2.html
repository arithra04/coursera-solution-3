      <p class="item-name">Chicken</p>
      <p> This is the best 5 ingredient back pocket recipe. Honey garlic is my jam: I can eat it on literally everything, including toast. It’s one of the easiest most flavorful sauces you can make at home and is a definite crowd pleaser.super easy, barely an inconvenience
        making it at home means your chicken can be extra saucy
        you can customize it to your own taste with extra garlic or not too much garlic
        it’s faster than delivery
        the pure satisfaction of a home cooked mealCook the chicken. Lightly pat your chicken dry, season it on all sides with salt and pepper then cook it in a pan with a bit of oil. When it’s cooked through, it’s time to add the garlic.
        Cook the garlic. Add the garlic to the pan (add a bit of oil if the pan is dry) and cook until it’s soft but not brown and smells amazingly garlicky.
        Add the sauce. Stir in honey, soy sauce, and vinegar and let it bubble away and thicken, coating all the nooks and crannies of the chicken.
        Enjoy! Remove the chicken from the pan along with all the sauce and enjoy!chicken – I used bone in skin on thighs because I love how much flavor you get from bone in chicken and I love chicken skin! You can use literally any part of the chicken that is your favorite. I’ve included a handy cooking time chart just below.
        garlic – this is a garlicky honey garlic with 6 fresh cloves. You can add more or have less based on your garlic preferences. For me, the more garlic the better. Oh, and save yourself some time and get a garlic press, it’s a prep game changer!<a href="#top">(Back to Top)</a></p>

      <p class="item-name">Beef</p>
      <p>Beef stew has to be one of the coziest, most comforting things to make and eat. Who doesn’t love tender, juicy little nubbins of beef and perfectly cooked potatoes, carrots, and onions all snuggled up in a rich and flavorful gravy? Pair a bowl with a loaf of crusty hot bread and you have my idea of heaven.

        At its heart, beef stew ingredients are very simple: aromatics, beef, vegetables, stock. Everyone knows and loves beef stew, but this beef stew is particularly good. It’s a take on my all time favorite stew ever, Vietnamese bo kho, a super flavorful rich and hearty stew.Generously season your beef and toss in some flour. The flour will help give body to the stew so it ends up just the right amount of thickness, between a sauce and a gravy.
        Add all the ingredients to the crockpot: the floured beef, onions, carrots, potatoes, tomato paste, beef broth and a couple of secret ingredients that I’ll go over more later in this post.
        Turn the crockpot on, and go about your life. Ten to twelve hours later, your stew will be perfectly cooked and ready to eat!Bo kho has all of your usual beef stew suspects: beef, onions, carrots, and potatoes, but the seasoning is where the fun happens. Lemongrass adds a zippy undertone and star anise, fennel and cinnamon add warmth. It’s SO good. If you’re looking for something super comforting, yet different, this is the beef stew for you.<a href="#top">(Back to Top)</a></p>

      <p class="item-name">Sushi</p>
      <p>Sushi Japanese food consists of cooked rice and is served cold. This staple rice dish is flavoured with various raw seafood garnishes, eggs, vegetables, and vinegar. Rice is undoubtedly the key ingredient of Sushi. Regardless of fillings or toppings, Sushi always includes Rice. An exotic dish, now it is easily available even at grocery stores. 

        However, the rice used in preparing sushi is medium-grained that is somewhat rounded, and the usual rice variety is Japonica. This rice variety contains higher starch levels. Since this rice variant is starchy, the rice holds shapes well and this makes it convenient to eat with chopsticks.
        
        There are two main kinds of Sushi, including Maki and Nigri. The Maki comprises Fish and rice rolled in a seaweed sheet called Nori. On the other hand, Nigri comprises an oval-shaped pile of rice with a slice of seafood or fish on top. The other types of Sushi include Uni Sushi and Temaki Sushi. Interestingly, many people believe that Sushi originated in Japan, but that’s not the case. Undoubtedly, Japan is indeed the sushi capital for introducing this lip-smacking dish to global travellers, but the origin of Sushi dates back to rice fields of China and a Chinese dish named Narezushi.

        A dish comprised of salted fish and fermented rice was believed to help prevent illness. It was in the 8the Century when Sushi was spread to Japan from China. This practical Sushi Chinese food gradually began to evolve in Japan, and a chef named Hanaya Yohei forever transformed the world of Sushi. Shortly after he experimented with Sushi, the dish began to spread across the globe. It began fetching popularity in the US.<a href="#top">(Back to Top)</a></p>
